Project: House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project involves building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on specific features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. Here are the steps to implement this:

Data Loading:
Load the dataset containing house data (e.g., from a CSV file or a database).
Data Preparation:
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (impute or remove).
Ensure that all numerical features are in a suitable format for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the relationships between each feature (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms) and the target variable (house prices) using scatter plots or other relevant visualizations.
Feature Selection:
Based on EDA and domain knowledge, decide which features to include in the model (e.g., square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms).
Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Instantiate a linear regression model using libraries like scikit-learn.
Train the model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
Interpret the model coefficients to understand how each feature impacts house prices.
Prediction:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new or test data.
Validate the predictions against actual house prices to evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.
